/*
This function has two arguments. The first argument serves as the key
for the shared memory segment. The second argument contains the
size (in bytes) of the shared memory segment to be allocated. The
return value for this function is a pointer to the shared memory area
which has been attached (and possibly created) by this function. If, for
some reason, this function cannot connect to the shared memory area
as requested, it shall return a NULL pointer. A program using this
library function must be able to use it to attach the maximum number
of shared memory segments to the calling process. (Note that Solaris
11 does not have a limit to the number of attachments, so you can use
the limit that Linux supports â€“ use the limit you find on our Linux server
absaroka.apl.jhu.edu).
